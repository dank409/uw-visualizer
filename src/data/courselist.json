Risk measures, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Tail Expectation (CTE or TVaR), are then introduced and their use by firms and regulators to determine risk capital requirements is further highlighted. Different approaches are considered for developing loss distributions, including frequency/severity analysis and extreme value theory. Copulas and economic scenario generators are used to aggregate dependent risks. Different strategies for mitigating or transferring risk are reviewed. Additional topics that may be covered include credit risk, capital allocation, and regulation of financial institutions.",

It introduces the concepts of heuristics and their use in conjunction with search methods, solving problems using heuristics and metaheuristics, constraints satisfaction. The course also introduces the concepts of co-operation and adaptations and how they are influencing new methods for solving complex problems. The course starts by illustrating how the concepts of co-operation and adaptation are manifested in nature and how such models are inspiring new types of solutions methods. Topics to be covered include search algorithms, game playing, constraints satisfaction, meta-heuristics, evolutionary computing methods, swarm intelligence, ant-colony algorithms, particle swarm methods, adaptive and learning algorithms and the use of these algorithms in solving continuous and discrete problems that arise in engineering applications.",

It starts by exploring solutions to the endogeneity problem in detail, emphasizing proper ways of conducting causal inference. It extends the methods covered in ECON322 to the case in which the data are observed over time. Students will learn how to estimate and interpret dynamic models and how these models affect our ability to do inference. The course also covers methods for data in which the response variable is either qualitative, with or without multiple levels, or count data. For that purpose, it introduces students to maximum likelihood estimation, and the estimation of models by probit, logit, and Poisson regressions. Assignments have the same data-based focus as in ECON322.",

This course introduces students to the notion of equilibrium for a market and market economy. The properties of such equilibria are explored, both in terms of model logic (existence, uniqueness) as well as in terms of the desirability of the equilibrium outcomes (efficiency, welfare). Partial equilibrium (in a single market) as well as general equilibrium (in all markets at once) are covered for models with endowments, production, uncertainty, and time.",

Then this framework will be used for theoretical generalizations of the model and their estimation using regression software. By the end of the course, students will be able to estimate a linear model and conduct accurate inference in cases where economic data violate the assumptions of the standard linear regression model. This includes methods for dealing with heteroskedastic data, observations that may be dependent over time, response distributions with heavy tails or limited range (such as binary outcomes and count variables), and observations that may suffer from selection bias.",

Recent studies suggest that much legislation is consistent with simple welfare concepts developed by economists.

A profound, world-wide shift in the nature of water governance is occurring because governments can no longer be the primary source of decision-making authority regarding water. Instead, through mechanisms that range from markets to co-management arrangements, citizens, non-government organizations, and corporations are now playing key roles in water governance. The course explores major water governance challenges in Canada, and assesses different ways of addressing or resolving them.",

However, we have also altered river form and function towards an 'unnatural' condition. This course analyzes the ways in which humans affect river systems, the physical and social mechanisms which complicate the relationship between humans and rivers, and how humans can restore rivers to a more natural state. This course also compares geomorphic, ecologic, and social functioning of rivers in pre- and post-alteration systems. The major theme of this course is navigating the delicate balance between allowing rivers to flow naturally and maintain ecologic functionality while simultaneously maintaining the river's ability to provide services of use to humans. What does human alteration of river systems mean for the current and future state of river ecology, morphology, and hydrology? Can we find a way for rivers to provide functionality that satisfies the needs of both society and nature? This course provides students with the background and tools to take on these and other essential questions and challenges.",

Through the reading of memoirs, students with an interest in aging, health care, and the therapeutic professions will grapple with the profound impact that caregiving during illness has on carers and relationships across the spectrum - from young carers, to intimate partners, to adult children caring for aging parents, and beyond. Discussions will be grounded in the social, legal, and policy contexts.",

Students will engage in close readings of primary and secondary sources to explore how and why certain diseases, like cancer and tuberculosis, were understood differently within these three paradigms. They will learn to engage in an interdisciplinary dialogue by applying humanities-based methodologies and vocabularies to the study of health and disease. By focusing on historical case studies and asking students to look at how ancient, medieval, and premodern people conceived of health, the course shows how all perceptions of well-being, including our own, are socially constructed and in constant negotiation.",

The course will cover both abstract and practical issues related to methodology and decision making in empirical research. You will have the opportunity to develop and workshop proposals that you may wish to pursue in your senior honours thesis. By the end of the course you will be a more informed consumer and have a basic set of skills for designing and implementing your own empirical research projects. Most importantly, you will have a foundation for future learning about research design and methods.",

The design project typically includes construction of a prototype, and part of the course grade may depend on the performance of the prototype in a competitive test. In exceptional circumstances, the requirement for a prototype may be replaced by a computer simulation, or may be waived.

Students will engage in critical readings of primary and secondary sources to learn about the care of bodies, management of disease and contagion, waste disposal, and food distribution in various medieval cities. This work will allow students to explore how notions of \"health\" and \"disease\" are cultural constructions that vary depending on the times and spaces in which they are used. Students will acquire humanities-based skills and theories to interrogate notions of health and well-being both historically and in today's societies.",

It does this by exploring the origins of Western medicine in premodern and medieval contexts. Students will engage in close readings of primary and secondary sources to explore how and why certain diseases, like cancer and tuberculosis, were understood differently within these three paradigms. They will learn to engage in an interdisciplinary dialogue by applying humanities-based methodologies and vocabularies to the study of health and disease. By focusing on historical case studies and asking students to look at how ancient, medieval, and premodern people conceived of health, the course shows how all perceptions of well-being, including our own, are socially constructed and in constant negotiation.",

Students learn about different approaches to design project and team management and communication, as well as the relationship between design and environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Students gain experience in the entire design cycle by working on a number of small design problems throughout the term. Students form teams and work on a term-long project centred on need finding and problem formulation. This activity is expected to result in a project topic that can be further developed in the capstone design series of courses (MSE401/402).",

Most of the term is devoted to a significant design project in which student groups work independently and competitively, applying the design process to a project goal set by the faculty coordinator. The design project typically includes construction of an electro-mechanical prototype, and part of the course grade may depend on the performance of the prototype in a competitive test. In exceptional circumstances, the requirement for a prototype may be replaced by a computer simulation, or may be waived.",

Maximum likelihood estimation. Random variables and distribution theory. Generating functions. Functions of random variables. Limiting distributions. Large sample theory of likelihood methods. Likelihood ratio tests. Joint probability (density) functions, marginal probability (density) functions, and conditional probability (density) functions of two or more random variables are discussed. Topics covered include independence of random variables, conditional expectation and the determination of the distribution of functions of random variables using the cumulative distribution method, change of variable and moment generating functions. Properties of the Multinomial and Bivariate Normal distributions are proved. Limiting distributions, including convergence in probability and convergence in distribution, are discussed. Important results, including the Weak Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem, Slutsky's theorem, and the Delta Method, are introduced with applications. The maximum likelihood method is discussed for the multi-parameter case. Asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator are examined and used to construct confidence intervals or regions. Tests for simple and composite hypotheses are constructed using the Likelihood Ratio Test.",

    "description": "The overwhelming majority of societal, ecological and climate issues of pressing importance are complex systems; nonlinear dynamic interacting systems poorly characterized by linear analyses and Gaussian statistics. This course introduces the mathematics needed to understand such interactions, including nonlinear dynamics, critical and bifurcation behaviours, large-scale systems and power-law distributions. The mathematical methods will be motivated by extensive examples and case studies such as global warming, energy shortages, desertification, overpopulation, poverty, and economic instability, to be investigated from a systems engineering perspective that will connect mathematical concepts to real-world examples.",
