# UW Visualizer

A modern course prerequisite visualization tool for University of Waterloo students. Explore course dependencies, plan your academic journey, and never miss a prerequisite again.

🌐 **Live Demo:** https://uwvisualizer.com

UW Visualizer helps students answer questions like:
- *What courses do I need to take to become eligible for COURSE X?*
- *Which prerequisites am I missing?*
- *How close am I to unlocking an upper-year course?*

Instead of parsing dense prerequisite text, the app renders prerequisite structures as an **interactive directed graph** with full AND / OR logic support.
