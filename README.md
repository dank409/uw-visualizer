# UW Visualizer

> **⚠️ In Development** - This project is actively being developed and may have incomplete features or bugs.

UW Visualizer helps students answer questions like:
- *What courses do I need to take to become eligible for COURSE X?*
- *Which prerequisites am I missing?*
- *How close am I to unlocking an upper-year course?*

Instead of parsing dense prerequisite text, the app renders prerequisite structures as an **interactive directed graph** with full AND / OR logic support.
