# UW Visualizer

A modern course prerequisite visualization tool for University of Waterloo students. Explore course dependencies, plan your academic journey, and never miss a prerequisite again.

🌐 **Live Demo:** https://uwvisualizer.com

UW Visualizer helps students answer questions like:
- *What courses do I need to take to become eligible for COURSE X?*
- *Which prerequisites am I missing?*
- *How close am I to unlocking an upper-year course?*

Instead of parsing dense prerequisite text, the app renders prerequisite structures as an **interactive directed graph** with full AND / OR logic support.

## Features

- 📊 **Interactive Prerequisite Graph** - Visualize course dependencies as an interactive node graph
- 🎯 **Program Filtering** - Filter courses by your academic program (CS, SE, Math, Engineering, etc.)
- 🔒 **Enrollment Restrictions** - See which programs can enroll in restricted courses
- ✅ **Progress Tracking** - Mark courses as completed or in progress
- 🌓 **Dark/Light Mode** - Toggle between themes
- 🔍 **Course Search** - Quickly find any course by code or title
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop browsers
